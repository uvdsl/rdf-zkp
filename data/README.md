Note that we use the TriG serialisation but as we are fundamentally working with RDF, the serialisation does ultimately not matter for the downstream transformation from RDF to ZKP related variables.

We could have also chosen to adhere to the JSON-LD serialisation (as prescribed by the W3C VC data model) but we deliberately prove the point, that we do not do JSON that happens to have a context property but that we actually consider the RDF in our method.
